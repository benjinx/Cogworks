# Cogworks
A toolkit for Unity, helpful for game jams and typical project utilities.

Just slap this into your Unity Assets and have fun!

# Installation

### Using the Unity Package Manager

I would recommend setup via adding the Git URL to the package manager inside of unity.
```
https://github.com/benjinx/Cogworks.git
```

Additional Option

Install the latest release using the Unity Package Manager by adding the following line to your `manifest.json` file located in your project's Packages directory.

```json
"com.froggygames.cogworks": "git+https://github.com/benjinx/Cogworks"
```
